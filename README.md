[Skydia Deployed Link](https://kemaldemirgil.github.io/skydia)

## About:
**Skydia** is a simple weather application which allows users to search for the current weather of the desired city, it also allows adding cities to their **Favourites List** which could be accessed anytime on their local computer. 

## Usage:
- Once navigated to the [application](https://kemaldemirgil.github.io/skydia), an **Entry Page** will be presented, simply click on the `ENTER` button to view the **Search Page**.
- In the **Search Page**, enter a city name to get the current weather. Hit the `Save to Favourites` button to add the city to your **Favourites list**.
- The **List** could be accessed through the *Navigation Bar* in the upper right corner of the page.
- In the **My Favourites Page**, select the city to view it's current weather, this will generate the current weather of that city. More information could be accessed through the `Click for more information` link at the bottom of the card.
- The city can be removed from the **Favourites List** by clicking on the `Delete City` button.

## Installation:
`Skydia` could also be running in your local computer however, I wouldn't recommend it since you would be needing an `API KEY` from [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and obtaining one could take *10 minutes to 2 hours*. Also, a `.env` file needs to be added to the root of the application using the following format for `React` applications.
```env
REACT_APP_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>
```
However, after those steps, simply pull this repository and run;
```bash
npm install
```
on the root of the directory. \
After installing the dependencies, run;
```bash
npm run start
```
to start the application on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Notes & Improvements:
Building this application using `Typescript` was challenging at the beginning, since it was my first time, it took many hours of troubleshooting to understand the flow of things however, once I was able to get comfortable with it, I realized the power that `Typescript` offers. Even though, writing strict code and specifying every type of element can be time-consuming for small projects like this one, on bigger applications it could definitely save many possible errors that might occur.
> I am aware that the `Favourites Page` should've displayed each city in a card format rather than selecting it through the dropdown however, unfortunately many bugs were present in my attempt on it. I even tried doing it using `Lazy Loading` where the user would click on a city card then the data would be fetched displaying the current weather but, that also brought many bugs to it. Furthermore, I understand the requirements and, this problem still could've been fixed however, in this case I was too focused on delivering the result as soon as possible.
